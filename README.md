- 3D models currently use placeholder geometry; implement GLB loader for actual models
- Environment variables are pre-configured but should be secured in production

### Ticket Assignment Debugging

If service providers report not seeing assigned tickets:

1. Open browser console in development mode
2. Run `window.diagnoseTickets()` to analyze ticket assignments
3. Run `window.fixTickets()` to automatically correct any issues
4. See `TICKET_DIAGNOSTICS.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide

The app includes comprehensive logging for:
- User authentication and profile loading
- Ticket queries and filtering
- Ticket assignment operations
